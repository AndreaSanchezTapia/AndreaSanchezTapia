I am a Colombian biologist (she/her). I work as a PNPD/CAPES post-doctoral fellow at the Scientific Computation Lab at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden.
My main interests are Biodiversity Informatics and Community Ecology.

[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.01.021105v1) - [ENM2020 YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Xw33TdIVXA)

- I co-founded [¡liibre!](https://github.com/liibre/) with Sara Mortara. We build R packages, teach free courses, and spread the word of [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/) and Octavia Butler (<3). We are also part of the Data team at the [Observatório COVID19-BR](https://covid19br.github.io/) and help co-organize [RLadies+ Rio de Janeiro](https://github.com/rladies-rio)
